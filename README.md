# go-resumable

It's a Go library providing multiple simultaneous and resumable uploads.

Library is designed to introduce fault-tolerance into the upload of large files throught HTTP.
This is done by splitting each file into small chunks; whenever the upload of a chunk fails, uploading is retried until the procedure completes.
This allows uploads to automatically resume uploading after a network connection is lost either locally or to the server.
Additionally, it allows users to pause, resume and even recover uploads without losing state.

### Demo

In this demo upload is paused for 2 seconds after initial second, then it uploads till 100%.
